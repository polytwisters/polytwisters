# Polytwisters

Polytwisters are strange curved four-dimensional shapes discovered by Jonathan Bowers. This repository is a port of Bowers' original POV-Ray file to Python, using Blender scripting.

## Running the script

Assuming Blender is in your PATH:

    blender --python polytwisters.py

On macOS, alias `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender` to `blender` before running the above.
